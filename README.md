seattle-theatre-site
====================

A site for finding theatrical productions in Seattle, and educating oneself about theatre art both generally, and as it pertains to the Seattle scene.

## Notes:

Currently the jsx build is done by hand. The concept is that the ./public/ folder will be generated by the build. However, the server code will make references to the output of the generated code. So it's basically impossible to run the thing before running the build. 

## Build Stuff, So Far:

Was able to use browserify like this:
browserify client/index.jsx public/index.js

However, realized what I really wanted was a jsx -> js transform for server consumption. This worked:
jsx -x jsx client/ public/
I am also doing:
jsx -x js client/ public/
as a hacky way to copy plain js files over for the moment.

I also am storing sql in yaml files for easy maintainance, so, coverting to json for js:
yaml2json ./client/pages/home/homeQueries.yaml > ./public/pages/home/homeQueries.json

These commands require global installs of: browserify, react-tools, yamljs.
