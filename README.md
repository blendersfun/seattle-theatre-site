seattle-theatre-site
====================

A site for finding theatrical productions in Seattle, and educating oneself about theatre art both generally, and as it pertains to the Seattle scene.

## Notes:

Currently the jsx build is done by hand. The concept is that the ./public/ folder will be generated by the build. However, the server code will make references to the output of the generated code. So it's basically impossible to run the thing before running the build. 

## Database:

I'm using mysql via the XAMPP project. To create the table structure assumming XAMPP is installed on a mac with all default settings, navigate to the "db" folder, then:

    /Applications/xampp/xamppfiles/bin/mysql -u root
    mysql> connect seattle_theatre;
    mysql> source create_tables.sql
    mysql> source snapshot.sql

I've symlinked mysql to a folder on the path, so I can just do "mysql" from the command-line and get to it. The destination database should be an empty database. If you have XAMPP installed, you can create one with phpMyAdmin.

Note to self: I've established a convention of commenting the snapshot date at the top of the snapshot sql file. This will enable tracibility between db structure and a snapshot of seed data via github.

## Build Stuff, So Far:

First, install gulp and react-tools as global dependencies:

    npm install -g gulp

Then install all local dependencies:

    npm install

To build:

    gulp build

To build and watch for changes:

    gulp

## Running the Server

From the root folder of the repository:

    node dist/private/server/server.js
