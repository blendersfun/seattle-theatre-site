## State of things, generally:

24th Dec - Christmas Eve:

I've got the React/Flux app bootstrapping on the client and server. Data is coming in from MySQL for venues, addresses and performances spaces and is just printing out in a plain list format. 

## Todo:
 - Create a build system. (gulp, watches filesystem, auto reload browser? [not sure I like...])
 x Verify that changing data updates via React as expected.
 - Build a component test harness.
 - Build v1 of the venue map.
